## üéØ **TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE STANDARDS**

### **Epic 5 Established Patterns (Foundation)**

**Content Management:**

```javascript
// JSON-based content with TypeScript validation
const contentStructure = {
  metadata: { version, lastUpdated, categories },
  items: [...contentArray],
  validation: ZodSchema,
};
```

**Routing Conventions:**

```
/[content-type]/           # Directory pages with filtering
/[content-type]/[slug]     # Individual content pages
```

**SEO Optimization:**

```html
<!-- Comprehensive meta tags -->
<meta name="description" content="{seo.metaDescription}" />
<meta property="og:title" content="{seo.metaTitle}" />
<!-- JSON-LD structured data -->
<script type="application/ld+json">
  {structuredData}
</script>
```

**Navigation Integration:**

```javascript
// Dynamic breadcrumb generation
const breadcrumbs = generateBreadcrumbs([
  { label: "Home", href: "/" },
  { label: contentTypeLabel, href: `/${contentType}` },
  { label: item.title, href: `/${contentType}/${item.slug}`, active: true },
]);
```

- Successful implementation can often succeed without anticipated dependencies
- Agile adaptation of architecture based on working solutions is valuable

**Implementation Success Patterns:**

- Comprehensive single-story delivery can be more effective than fragmented multi-story approach
- Working solutions should drive architectural decisions rather than theoretical dependencies
- Documentation should reflect implementation reality, not just planning intentions

**Going Forward Principles:**

- Prioritize working implementations over architectural purity
- Adapt documentation to match successful patterns
- Use proven implementation patterns as foundation for future development
