### **Epic 4 Integration (Weeks 1-4)**

- **Build on Epic 5**: Quality gates validate content architecture
- **Independent Implementation**: No dependencies on Epic 1&2
- **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive integration testing for existing Epic 5

### **Epic 3 Integration (Weeks 5-8)**

- **Leverage Epic 5**: Use established content patterns for course data
- **Student Experience**: Portal integrates with content architecture
- **Data Flow**: Student portal ‚Üí course content ‚Üí staff profiles
- **Navigation**: Extend Epic 5 breadcrumb system for portal navigation
