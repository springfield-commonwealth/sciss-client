# Epic 4: CI/CD & DevOps Enhancement - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Enhance the existing GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline with quality gates, automatic deployment, and monitoring capabilities to support the SCISS platform modernization initiative while maintaining production system reliability.

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context

**Current CI/CD Infrastructure:**

- **Technology Stack**: GitHub Actions with Node.js 20, pnpm 8, Next.js static export
- **Existing Workflows**:
  - `develop.yml` - Automated validation for PRs and non-main branches
  - `manual-deploy.yml` - Manual production deployment via workflow dispatch
- **Deployment Method**: rsync to Hostinger shared hosting via SSH
- **Quality Checks**: ESLint, TypeScript checking, Jest testing
- **Integration Points**: Connects to Epic 1 & 2 testing requirements for enhanced components

**Current Deployment Process:**

1. Developer triggers manual workflow dispatch
2. Automated build and test validation
3. SSH deployment to Hostinger production server
4. Manual verification of deployment success

### Enhancement Details

**What's Being Enhanced:**

1. **Quality Gates Integration** - Connect Epic 1 & 2 component testing requirements
2. **Automatic Production Deployment** - Deploy automatically on successful main branch merges
3. **Enhanced Environment Management** - Improved staging and preview environments
4. **Post-Deployment Monitoring** - Health checks and basic alerting capabilities

**How It Integrates:**

- Extends existing GitHub Actions workflows rather than replacing them
- Builds upon current rsync deployment method to Hostinger
- Integrates with Epic 1 & 2 testing strategies for component validation
- Maintains existing SSH-based deployment security model

**Success Criteria:**

- Automatic deployment on main branch merges with zero manual intervention
- Quality gates prevent deployment of Epic 1 & 2 regressions
- Deployment health monitoring with basic alerting
- 99%+ deployment success rate with rollback capabilities

## Stories

### 1. **Story 4.1: Quality Gates & Epic Integration Testing**

Integrate Epic 1 & 2 testing requirements into CI/CD pipeline with quality gates that prevent deployment of regressions in button interactions, form validation, Radix components, and design system consistency.

### 2. **Story 4.2: Automatic Production Deployment Pipeline**

Enhance existing manual deployment workflow to automatically deploy to production on successful main branch merges, with approval gates and deployment notifications.

### 3. **Story 4.3: Enhanced Environment Management & Preview Deploys**

Create staging environment automation and preview deployments for Epic 1 & 2 feature branches, enabling testing of component changes before production.

### 4. **Story 4.4: Post-Deployment Monitoring & Health Checks**

Implement basic health checks, deployment verification, and alerting to ensure Epic 1 & 2 enhancements function correctly in production environment.

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing GitHub Actions workflows remain functional
- [x] Current SSH-based deployment method preserved
- [x] Hostinger hosting infrastructure unchanged
- [x] Manual deployment option maintained as fallback
- [x] Existing testing commands and scripts preserved
- [x] Performance impact on build/deploy time is minimal (<20% increase)

## Risk Mitigation

**Primary Risk:** Automated deployment introduces regression risk to production SCISS platform
**Mitigation:**

- Comprehensive quality gates with Epic 1 & 2 component testing
- Gradual rollout with manual approval gates initially
- Robust rollback automation with previous deployment restoration
- Deployment health checks with automatic rollback triggers

**Secondary Risk:** Enhanced CI/CD complexity impacts developer productivity
**Mitigation:**

- Maintain existing manual deployment as fallback option
- Clear documentation and debugging guides
- Progressive enhancement approach - add features incrementally
- Developer training and support during transition

**Rollback Plan:**

- Immediate: Disable automatic deployment, revert to manual workflow dispatch
- Quick: Restore previous GitHub Actions workflow files from git history
- Complete: Revert to local deployment script (deploy.sh) as ultimate fallback

## Definition of Done

- [x] Automatic deployment works reliably on main branch merges
- [x] Quality gates prevent Epic 1 & 2 component regressions
- [x] Staging environment enables pre-production testing
- [x] Basic monitoring confirms deployment health and Epic feature functionality
- [x] Developer documentation updated with new CI/CD processes
- [x] Rollback procedures tested and documented
- [x] No regression in existing deployment reliability
- [x] Epic 1 & 2 component testing integrated into deployment pipeline

## Integration with Epic 1 & 2

**Epic 1 Integration Points:**

- Button interaction state testing in CI pipeline
- Form validation animation testing
- Progressive form feature testing
- Breadcrumb navigation testing

**Epic 2 Integration Points:**

- Radix UI component testing
- Design system token integration validation
- Accessibility compliance testing (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Performance testing for new component library

**Quality Gate Requirements:**

- All Epic 1 & 2 component tests must pass before deployment
- Visual regression testing for design system consistency
- Performance benchmarks maintained for enhanced components
- Accessibility testing prevents WCAG compliance regressions
