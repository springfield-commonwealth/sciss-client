# Epic 5: Content Architecture Modernization - Blog Post System

## Epic Goal

Transform the SCISS website from monolithic content structure to individual content pages with JSON-based architecture, enabling better SEO, content discoverability, and scalable content management while maintaining all existing functionality and user experience.

## Epic Description

### Existing Platform Context

**Current SCISS Content Architecture:**

- **Content Structure**: Monolithic JavaScript constants in `src/constants/*.js` files
- **Page Architecture**: Single pages for academics, life-activities, day-trips with embedded content
- **SEO Limitations**: No individual content URLs, limited discoverability for specific courses/activities
- **Content Management**: Manual code updates required for content changes
- **Integration Points**: Enhanced by Epic 1 (UX improvements) and Epic 2 (Radix UI components)

**Current Content Organization:**

- **Academic Programs**: All course information embedded in `/academics` page
- **Life Activities**: All sports/fitness programs in `/life-activities` page
- **Day Trips**: All university visits and cultural trips in `/day-trips` page
- **Faculty Information**: Staff details scattered across different content constants
- **SEO Impact**: Missing individual page optimization for specific educational offerings

### Enhancement Strategy

**What's Being Transformed:**

1. **Individual Content Pages** - Each course, activity, trip gets dedicated URL with Next.js dynamic routing
2. **JSON Content Architecture** - Structured data replacing JavaScript constants for better maintainability
3. **SEO Optimization** - Individual meta tags, structured data, and social sharing for each content piece
4. **Staff Profile System** - Dedicated lecturer and staff profile pages with biographical information
5. **Content Categorization** - Tagging and categorization system for improved discovery
6. **Navigation Enhancement** - Overview pages become content directories with links to individual pages

**How It Integrates:**

- Leverages Epic 1 enhanced interactions for improved content navigation
- Utilizes Epic 2 Radix UI components for accessible content interfaces
- Maintains existing Next.js static export for Hostinger hosting compatibility
- Preserves all current educational content while adding individual page access
- Builds upon established design system and component architecture

**Success Criteria:**

- Individual SEO-optimized pages for all courses, activities, trips, and staff
- Improved search engine discoverability for specific SCISS educational offerings
- Scalable content management system ready for future CMS integration
- Zero disruption to existing navigation and user experience
- Enhanced content accessibility and mobile optimization
