# Story 1.2: Form Validation Micro-Animations

## Status

Completed

## Story

**As a** prospective student or parent filling out the SCISS application form,
**I want** to receive immediate, clear visual feedback when validation errors occur or fields are successfully completed,
**so that** I can quickly understand and correct any issues while feeling confident about the information I've provided, reducing form abandonment and improving completion rates.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Error State Animations**: Form fields with validation errors display a subtle shake animation and clear error styling
2. **Success State Feedback**: Successfully completed required fields show positive visual confirmation
3. **Real-time Validation**: Email field validation provides immediate feedback with appropriate animations
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Animations respect user preferences (prefers-reduced-motion)
5. **Consistent Timing**: All form animations use the same timing functions established in Story 1.1
6. **File Upload Feedback**: Drag-and-drop area provides animated feedback for different states (hover, dragover, success, error)
7. **Smooth Transitions**: Error messages appear and disappear with smooth animations rather than jarring changes

### Technical Context from Architecture

**Current Form Implementation**: [Source: .cursor/docs/architect.md#form-validation-architecture]

- ApplicationForm.js: 700+ line sophisticated form with complex validation
- useApplicationForm hook: Custom state management with Zod validation
- Email validation API: Real-time email availability checking
- File upload system: Custom transcript file validation with drag-and-drop

**Existing Form Structure**: [Source: .cursor/docs/architect.md#component-architecture]

- Main form: `src/components/forms/ApplicationForm.js`
- Form hook: `src/hooks/useApplicationForm.js`
- Form styles: `src/styles/components/application-form.css`
- Validation schema: `src/lib/schemas/applicationFormSchema.js`

**Form Validation Patterns**: [Source: .cursor/docs/architect.md#form-validation-architecture]

```javascript
// Current validation approach
const {
  formValues,
  isSubmitting,
  submitError,
  getFieldError,
  onEmailBlur,
  emailValidation,
  isEmailValidating,
} = useApplicationForm();
```

**CSS Animation Foundation**: [Source: Story 1.1 completion]

- Established timing functions: `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)`
- Consistent transition durations: 0.2s for interactions, 0.3s for transforms
- Performance-optimized transforms using GPU acceleration
- Accessibility considerations with prefers-reduced-motion

**Design System Integration**: [Source: .cursor/docs/architect.md#css-architecture]

- Error colors: `--error-color: #cc1d2f`
- Success colors: `--success-color: #27AE60`
- Form styling: Existing comprehensive form CSS architecture
- Shadow system: `--shadow-subtle`, `--shadow-medium` for depth

**File Upload Implementation**: [Source: .cursor/docs/architect.md#form-validation]

```javascript
// Current drag-and-drop patterns
const handleDrag = (e) => {
  /* existing implementation */
};
const handleDrop = (e) => {
  /* existing file validation */
};
```

### Animation Specifications

**Shake Animation for Errors**:

```css
@keyframes shake {
  0%,
  100% {
    transform: translateX(0);
  }
  25% {
    transform: translateX(-5px);
  }
  75% {
    transform: translateX(5px);
  }
}
```

**File Upload Animation States**:

- Hover: Subtle scale (1.02) with border color transition
- Dragover: Enhanced scale (1.05) with background color change
- Success: Brief scale pulse with green accent
- Error: Shake animation with red border flash

### Testing

**Testing Standards**: [Source: .cursor/docs/architect.md#testing-infrastructure]

- Test framework: Jest + React Testing Library
- Form testing: Existing comprehensive form validation tests
- Test location: `src/components/forms/__tests__/`

- Animation trigger testing (validation errors, success states)
- Email validation animation flow testing
- File upload interaction animation testing
- Accessibility testing for reduced motion preferences
- Animation timing validation (duration, easing functions)
- Screen reader compatibility with animated states

### Integration Points

**Hook Integration**: [Source: .cursor/docs/architect.md#form-architecture]

- useApplicationForm hook: Add animation state management
- Email validation: Integrate loading/success/error animation triggers
- File handling: Connect drag-and-drop states with animation system
