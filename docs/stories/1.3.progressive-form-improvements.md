# Story 1.3: Progressive Form Improvements

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** prospective student or parent using the SCISS application form,
**I want** to experience a smart, progressive form that saves my progress, guides me through completion, and adapts to my input,
**so that** I never lose my work, can complete the application at my own pace, and feel confident that I'm providing the right information without frustration.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Auto-Save Draft Functionality**: Form automatically saves progress to localStorage every 2 seconds after changes
2. **Progress Indication**: Visual progress indicator shows completion percentage and remaining sections
3. **Smart Field Disclosure**: Optional and conditional fields appear progressively based on user selections
4. **Draft Recovery**: Users can recover and continue from saved drafts with clear recovery prompts
5. **Enhanced Accessibility**: Form sections have proper landmarks and screen reader navigation support
6. **Smart Validation Timing**: Validation occurs at optimal moments (onBlur for most fields, real-time for critical fields)
7. **Completion Guidance**: Clear indication of required vs optional fields with helpful completion tips

## Dev Notes

### Technical Context from Architecture

**Current Form Architecture**: [Source: .cursor/docs/architect.md#form-validation-architecture]

- ApplicationForm.js: 700+ line sophisticated form with complex validation
- useApplicationForm hook: Custom state management with comprehensive validation
- Form sections: Student info, parent info, program selection, file uploads
- Validation: Zod schema with 160+ lines of complex validation rules

**State Management Pattern**: [Source: .cursor/docs/architect.md#form-architecture]

```javascript
// Current form state structure
const {
  formValues,
  isSubmitting,
  submitSuccess,
  submitError,
  onChange,
  onFileChange,
  onSubmit,
  resetForm,
  getFieldError,
  onEmailBlur,
  emailValidation,
  isEmailValidating,
} = useApplicationForm();
```

**Form Field Structure**: [Source: .cursor/docs/architect.md#form-validation]

- Student information: Name, preferred name, DOB, gender, grade, nationality
- Parent/Guardian: Contact information, emergency contacts
- Program selection: Course options, sports preferences, session selection
- Financial: Financial aid requests (conditional field)
- File uploads: Transcript uploads (conditional based on financial aid)

**Dependency on Previous Stories**: [Source: Stories 1.1, 1.2]

- Button interaction states: Enhanced form submission and navigation buttons
- Form validation animations: Smooth error/success feedback system
- Animation timing standards: Consistent cubic-bezier transitions
- Accessibility foundation: Screen reader and keyboard navigation support

### Progressive Enhancement Strategy

**Auto-Save Implementation**:

```javascript
// Proposed hook structure
const useDraftSave = (formValues, key = "sciss-application-draft") => {
  useEffect(() => {
    const draftData = localStorage.getItem(key);
    if (draftData) return JSON.parse(draftData);
  }, []);

  useEffect(() => {
    const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
      localStorage.setItem(
        key,
        JSON.stringify({
          data: formValues,
          timestamp: Date.now(),
          version: "1.0",
        })
      );
    }, 2000);
    return () => clearTimeout(timeoutId);
  }, [formValues]);
};
```

**Progress Calculation Logic**:

- Required fields completion: 60% weight
- Optional fields completion: 30% weight
- File uploads completion: 10% weight
- Minimum viable submission: 70% completion threshold

**Progressive Disclosure Rules**:

- Financial aid fields: Show when "Yes" selected for financial aid
- Transcript upload: Show when financial aid requested
- Advanced contact options: Show when "Show more options" clicked
- Emergency contact 2: Show when primary emergency contact completed

### Technical Integration Points

**localStorage Management**: [Source: .cursor/docs/architect.md#technical-constraints]

- Data persistence: JSON serialization with version control
- Expiration handling: 30-day automatic cleanup
- Data validation: Ensure saved data matches current schema
- Migration strategy: Handle form structure changes gracefully

**Performance Considerations**: [Source: .cursor/docs/architect.md#performance-focus]

- Debounced saves to prevent excessive localStorage writes
- Lazy loading of progressive disclosure sections
- Memoized progress calculations
- Efficient re-render optimization for form state changes

**Accessibility Enhancements**: [Source: .cursor/docs/architect.md#accessibility]

- ARIA landmarks: form sections with proper labeling
- Screen reader navigation: skip links and section announcements
- Keyboard navigation: tab order preservation with progressive disclosure
- Focus management: proper focus handling for dynamic content

### Testing

**Testing Standards**: [Source: .cursor/docs/architect.md#testing-infrastructure]

- Test framework: Jest + React Testing Library
- Form testing: Existing comprehensive validation test suite
- Test location: `src/components/forms/__tests__/`, `src/hooks/__tests__/`

**Specific Testing Requirements for This Story**:

- Auto-save functionality: localStorage integration, debouncing, recovery
- Progress calculation: Accurate percentage calculations for different scenarios
- Progressive disclosure: Dynamic field rendering, animation states
- Accessibility: Screen reader navigation, keyboard interaction
- Performance: Render optimization, localStorage efficiency
- Integration: Compatibility with Stories 1.1 and 1.2 enhancements

### Browser Compatibility

**localStorage Requirements**: [Source: .cursor/docs/architect.md#technical-constraints]

- Modern browser support (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+)
- localStorage availability detection and graceful fallback
- Storage quota management and cleanup strategies
- Data corruption handling and recovery mechanisms
