# Story 1.4: Breadcrumb Navigation Component

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** prospective student or parent navigating through the SCISS website,
**I want** to see a clear breadcrumb trail showing my current location and providing easy navigation back to parent pages,
**so that** I never feel lost in the site hierarchy and can efficiently navigate between related sections without losing my context.

## Acceptance Criteria

## Dev Notes

### Technical Context from Architecture

**Current Navigation System**: [Source: .cursor/docs/architect.md#navigation-architecture]

- Navigation.js: Main navigation with desktop/mobile responsive design
- DesktopNav.js: Dropdown menu system with hover/focus states
- MobileNav.js: Mobile overlay navigation with accordion dropdowns
- useNavigationState hook: Custom state management for navigation interactions

**Navigation Structure**: [Source: .cursor/docs/architect.md#navigation-architecture]

```javascript
// Current navigation hierarchy
const navLinks = [
  {
    label: "Program",
    href: "/program-overview",
    children: [
      { href: "/program-overview", label: "Overview" },
      { href: "/tuitions-and-fees", label: "Tuitions & Fees" },
    ],
  },
  {
    label: "Academics",
    href: "/academics",
    children: [
      { href: "/academics#core-courses-carousel", label: "Core Courses" },
      { href: "/academics#electives-carousel", label: "Electives" },
      // ... additional sub-items
    ],
  },
  // ... additional nav items
];
```

**Layout Integration**: [Source: .cursor/docs/architect.md#component-architecture]

- Layout.js: Main page wrapper with Navigation, main content, FooterCTA, Footer
- Navigation positioning: Fixed header with backdrop blur
- Content structure: Main content area with proper spacing and margins
- Responsive design: Well-established mobile/desktop patterns

**Routing Architecture**: [Source: .cursor/docs/architect.md#technical-stack]

- Next.js file-based routing with pages directory structure
- Static export configuration for deployment optimization
- Route patterns: Standard Next.js routing with nested pages
- Navigation state: useRouter for current route detection

### Breadcrumb Component Design

**Component Structure**:

```javascript
// Proposed breadcrumb component pattern
const Breadcrumb = ({ customRoutes = {} }) => {
  const router = useRouter();
  const breadcrumbs = useBreadcrumbs(router.pathname, customRoutes);

  return (
    <nav aria-label="Breadcrumb" className="breadcrumb">
      <ol className="breadcrumb-list">
        {breadcrumbs.map((crumb, index) => (
          <BreadcrumbItem
            key={crumb.href}
            {...crumb}
            isLast={index === breadcrumbs.length - 1}
          />
        ))}
      </ol>
    </nav>
  );
};
```

**Route Mapping Strategy**:

```javascript
// Breadcrumb configuration for SCISS site structure
const breadcrumbConfig = {
  "/": { label: "Home" },
  "/program-overview": { label: "Program Overview", parent: "/" },
  "/tuitions-and-fees": {
    label: "Tuitions & Fees",
    parent: "/program-overview",
  },
  "/academics": { label: "Academics", parent: "/" },
  "/life-activities": { label: "Life & Activities", parent: "/" },
  "/day-trips": { label: "Day Trips", parent: "/" },
  "/about-us": { label: "About Us", parent: "/" },
  "/apply": { label: "Apply Now", parent: "/" },
};
```

**Animation Integration**: [Source: Stories 1.1-1.3]

- Consistent timing: `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)` transitions
- Hover states: Subtle color transitions for interactive breadcrumb links
- Focus indicators: Enhanced focus styles consistent with button improvements
- Mobile transitions: Smooth collapse/expand animations for responsive design

### Styling & Design System Integration

**CSS Architecture Integration**: [Source: .cursor/docs/architect.md#css-architecture]

- Component styles: `src/styles/components/breadcrumb.css`
- Design system variables: Leverage existing color and spacing tokens
- Typography: Consistent with navigation and body text hierarchy
- Visual hierarchy: Clear distinction between levels and current page

**Design System Variables**: [Source: .cursor/docs/architect.md#css-architecture]

```css
/* Available design tokens for breadcrumb styling */
--text-dark: #2c3e50;
--text-medium: #5a6c7d;
--text-light: #7f8c8d;
--primary-blue: #1f56a4;
--border-light: #e1e8ed;
--shadow-subtle: 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
```

**Responsive Design Patterns**: [Source: .cursor/docs/architect.md#responsive-design]

- Mobile-first approach with progressive enhancement
- Container max-width: 75vw with responsive adjustment
- Breakpoints: 768px (mobile), 1024px (tablet), 1200px (desktop)
- Touch targets: Minimum 44px for mobile interactions

### SEO & Structured Data

**BreadcrumbList Schema**:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "BreadcrumbList",
  "itemListElement": [
    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 1,
      "name": "Home",
      "item": "https://sciss.example.com/"
    }
