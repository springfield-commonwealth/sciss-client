# Story 3.3: Student Progress Tracking & Analytics

## Status

PLANNED - Not Yet Started

## Story

**As a** student and instructor in SCISS summer programs,
**I want** comprehensive progress tracking and analytics for academic performance and engagement,
**so that** students can monitor their learning journey and instructors can provide personalized guidance and support.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Individual Progress Dashboard**: Students see their progress across all courses, assignments, and activities
2. **Learning Analytics**: Track engagement metrics (time spent, materials accessed, assignment completion rates)

4. **Instructor Analytics Dashboard**: Instructors view class-wide and individual student progress
5. **Predictive Insights**: System provides recommendations for improvement and identifies at-risk students
