# Story 4.1: Quality Gates & Epic Integration Testing

## Status

- **Current Phase:** Draft
- **Assigned Developer:** TBD
- **Story Points:** 8
- **Epic:** Epic 4 - CI/CD & DevOps Enhancement
- **Dependencies:** Epic 1 & 2 testing strategies established
- **Estimated Completion:** 1 week

## User Story

**As a** SCISS platform developer and maintainer  
**I want** comprehensive quality gates integrated into our CI/CD pipeline that validate Epic 1 & 2 component enhancements  
**So that** we prevent regressions in button interactions, form validation, Radix UI components, and design system consistency from reaching production.

## Background Context

The SCISS platform is implementing comprehensive modernization through Epic 1 (Design & UX Enhancement) and Epic 2 (Component Architecture Refactoring with Radix UI). These epics introduce:

- **Epic 1**: Enhanced button states, form validation animations, progressive form improvements, breadcrumb navigation
- **Epic 2**: Radix UI form controls, navigation components, modal/dialog system, design system token integration

**Current CI/CD State**: Existing GitHub Actions workflows (`develop.yml`, `manual-deploy.yml`) provide basic validation (ESLint, TypeScript, Jest) but lack specific testing for the enhanced component interactions and design system consistency that Epic 1 & 2 require.

**Business Impact**: Without proper quality gates, Epic 1 & 2 enhancements could introduce regressions in user interactions, accessibility compliance, design consistency, or performance - directly impacting the educational platform's usability and professional presentation.

## Acceptance Criteria

## Dev Notes

### **Architecture Integration Points**

**Current Testing Infrastructure:**
[Source: .bmad-core/architect.md#testing-patterns]

- Jest + React Testing Library for component testing
- Existing TypeScript strict configuration for type safety
- ESLint + Prettier for code quality
- Manual testing procedures for form validation

**GitHub Actions Integration:**
[Source: .github/workflows/develop.yml]

```yaml
# Current workflow includes:
- name: Run tests
  run: pnpm run test:ci
```

**Required Enhancement:**

```yaml
# Add to GitHub Actions workflow
- name: Run Epic Quality Gates
  run: pnpm run quality-gates

- name: Generate Quality Gate Report
  run: pnpm run quality-gates:report
```

    // Validate GPU acceleration usage
    // Check for layout thrashing
  });
});
```

**Bundle Size Monitoring:**

```javascript
// Use bundlesize or similar for automated monitoring
"bundlesize": [
  {
    "path": "./dist/**/*.js",
    "maxSize": "250kb",
    "compression": "gzip"
  }
]
```

**Accessibility Testing Integration:**

```javascript
// Use @axe-core/react for automated accessibility testing
import { axe, toHaveNoViolations } from "jest-axe";

describe("Accessibility Compliance", () => {
  test("Epic 1 & 2 components meet WCAG 2.1 AA", async () => {
    const results = await axe(container);
    expect(results).toHaveNoViolations();
  });
