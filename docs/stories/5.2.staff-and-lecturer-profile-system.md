## Dev Notes

### Technical Context from Architecture

**Current Faculty Content Implementation**: [Source: .cursor/docs/architect.md#content-management-strategy]

The SCISS platform currently manages faculty information within `academicsContent.js` as part of the centralized constants pattern. Faculty profiles are displayed in section components, particularly in the academics page faculty section.

**Existing Component Architecture**: [Source: .cursor/docs/architect.md#ui-components]

- **Faculty Cards**: Existing `FacultyCard.js` component in `src/components/ui/`
- **Faculty Section**: `FacultySection.js` in `src/components/sections/` displays faculty grid
- **Layout System**: `Layout.js` provides consistent page wrapper for all content pages
- **Navigation**: Faculty accessible via `/academics#faculty` anchor navigation

### Staff Content Requirements Analysis

**Current Faculty Data Structure** (from academicsContent.js analysis):

Faculty objects currently contain:

- Basic information: name, title, photo
- Professional background: education, experience
- Course assignments and specializations
- Contact information and availability

**Enhanced Staff Structure Needed**:

```typescript
interface StaffProfile {
  // Basic Information
  slug: string; // URL identifier (kebab-case)
  name: {
    first: string;
    last: string;
    preferredName?: string;
  };
  title: string; // Professional title
  department: string; // Academic department/area

  // Professional Information
  photo: {
    src: string; // Photo path
    alt: string; // Accessibility description
  };
  bio: string; // Professional biography
  education: Array<{
    degree: string;
    institution: string;
    year?: number;
  }>;
  experience: Array<{
    position: string;
    organization: string;
    duration: string;
  }>;

  // Educational Information
  teachingPhilosophy: string; // Teaching approach
  expertise: string[]; // Areas of expertise
  courses: string[]; // Courses taught at SCISS
  credentials: string[]; // Professional certifications

  // Contact Information
  email?: string; // Professional contact
  officeHours?: string; // Availability for students

  // Metadata
  isActive: boolean; // Currently with SCISS
  joinDate: string; // When joined SCISS
  publications?: string[]; // Academic publications
}
```

### Integration with Story 5.1 Content Infrastructure

**Content Directory Integration**: [Source: Story 5.1 Content Infrastructure Foundation]

Staff profiles will be stored in the `content/staff/` directory established in Story 5.1:

```text
content/staff/
├── john-smith.json              # Individual staff profile
├── sarah-johnson.json           # Individual staff profile
├── michael-brown.json           # Individual staff profile
└── index.ts                     # Staff type exports and validation
```

**TypeScript Interface Location**: Extends `content/types.ts` from Story 5.1
**Zod Schema Location**: Extends `src/lib/schemas/contentSchemas.ts` from Story 5.1

### Next.js Dynamic Routing Implementation

**Staff Page Route Pattern**: `/pages/staff/[slug].js`

**Static Generation Implementation**:

```javascript
// pages/staff/[slug].js implementation pattern
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  // Load all staff profiles from content/staff/
  // Generate paths for each staff member slug
  return {
    paths: staffSlugs.map((slug) => ({ params: { slug } })),
    fallback: false, // Static export compatibility
  };
}

export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  // Load specific staff profile by slug
  // Validate content using Zod schema from Story 5.1
  return {
    props: {
      staffProfile: validatedStaffData,
    },
  };
}
```

### Design System Integration

**SCISS Branding Consistency**: [Source: .cursor/docs/architect.md#css-architecture]

- **Color System**: Use existing `--primary-blue`, `--secondary-blue` for professional appearance
- **Typography**: Maintain Inter font family and heading hierarchy
- **Component Reuse**: Leverage existing card components and section layouts
- **Responsive Design**: Follow established mobile-first approach

**Professional Layout Requirements**:

- Professional headshot with appropriate sizing and positioning
- Clear hierarchy: Name → Title → Department → Bio
- Credentials displayed with appropriate visual weight
- Contact information accessible but not prominently displayed
- Teaching philosophy highlighted for educational context

### SEO and Professional Metadata Implementation

**Structured Data Schema**: JSON-LD Person schema with professional context

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Person",
  "name": "Dr. Sarah Johnson",
  "jobTitle": "Associate Professor of Business Leadership",
  "worksFor": {
    "@type": "EducationalOrganization",
    "name": "SCISS"
  },
  "expertise": ["Business Strategy", "Leadership Development"],
  "alumniOf": "Harvard Business School"
}
```

**Professional SEO Optimization**:

- Meta titles: "Dr. Sarah Johnson - Business Leadership Professor | SCISS"
- Meta descriptions emphasizing expertise and educational value
- Keywords targeting academic specializations and teaching areas

### Integration with Existing Faculty Sections

**Faculty Section Enhancement Strategy**:

1. **Preserve Existing Functionality**: Current faculty sections continue to work
2. **Add Profile Links**: Faculty cards link to individual `/staff/[slug]` pages
3. **Enhanced Information**: Individual pages provide comprehensive details
4. **Back Navigation**: Clear navigation back to course/department context

**Component Integration**: Update `FacultySection.js` to include profile links while maintaining existing design and functionality

### Accessibility and Professional Standards

**Accessibility Requirements**:

- Professional headshots with descriptive alt text
- Proper heading hierarchy for screen readers
- Contact information accessible via keyboard navigation
- Clear focus indicators for interactive elements

**Professional Presentation Standards**:

- Consistent professional tone across all profiles
- Standardized credential formatting
- Clear separation of academic vs professional experience
- Appropriate emphasis on educational qualifications
