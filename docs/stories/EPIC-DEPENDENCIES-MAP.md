### **Technical Integration Points**

#### **🎨 Animation & Interaction Standards**

**Epic 1 Establishes → Epic 2 Applies**

```javascript
// Epic 1.1 establishes timing standards
const ANIMATION_TIMING = 'cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)';
const INTERACTION_DURATION = '0.2s';

// Epic 2.1-2.4 apply to Radix components
.radix-select-trigger {
  transition: all 0.2s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);
}
```

**Dependencies:**

- **2.1** Must use Epic 1.1 button interaction timing for Radix triggers
- **2.2** Must apply Epic 1.1 focus indicators to Radix navigation
- **2.3** Must integrate Epic 1.1 button states in modal actions
- **2.4** Must systematize Epic 1.1 animation standards across all Radix components

#### **📝 Form Enhancement Pipeline**

**Epic 1 Foundation → Epic 2 Enhancement**

```javascript
// Epic 1.2 establishes validation animation patterns
const ValidationAnimation = {
  error: "shake 0.3s ease-in-out",
  success: "subtle positive feedback",
  timing: "cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)",
};

// Epic 2.1 integrates with Radix form controls
const RadixFormControl = {
  validation: ValidationAnimation,
  accessibility: "Enhanced ARIA support",
  functionality: "Search, grouping, keyboard navigation",
};
```

**Dependencies:**

- **2.1** MUST integrate Epic 1.2 validation animations with Radix state management
- **2.1** MUST apply Epic 1.3 auto-save functionality to enhanced Radix forms
- **2.3** MUST coordinate Epic 1.3 help modals with Radix Dialog system

#### **🧭 Navigation Enhancement Chain**

**Epic 1 Patterns → Epic 2 Implementation**

```javascript
// Epic 1.4 establishes breadcrumb navigation patterns
const NavigationPatterns = {
  breadcrumbs: "Route-based generation with ARIA landmarks",
  activeStates: "Consistent with main navigation",
  mobileOptimization: "Responsive design patterns",
};

// Epic 2.2 enhances with Radix NavigationMenu
const RadixNavigation = {
  enhanced: NavigationPatterns,
  accessibility: "Superior keyboard navigation",
  mobile: "Better touch interactions",
};
```

**Dependencies:**

- **2.2** MUST coordinate with Epic 1.4 breadcrumb implementation
- **2.2** MUST apply Epic 1.1 interaction states to Radix navigation elements
- **2.4** MUST ensure breadcrumb design tokens align with Radix navigation styling
